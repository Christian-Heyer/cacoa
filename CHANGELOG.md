## [Upcoming]

### Changed

- Small bug fixes and usability improvements
- Renamed options for `dist.type` in `estimateExpressionShiftMagnitudes` to match the paper figure
- Renamed inner `estimateExpressionShiftMagnitudes` to `estimateExpressionChange` (CRAN requirement)
- Renamed `p.adj.cutoff` to `p.adj` in `estimateDEStabilityPerGene` for consistency with other functions
